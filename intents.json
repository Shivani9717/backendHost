Sprinkler irrigation: Sprays water over the crop area, suitable for a variety of crops.\n     3. Furrow irrigation: Uses channels to direct water between crop rows.\n       4. Use weather-based irrigation controllers to optimize water usage.\n      5. Avoid over-irrigation to prevent waterlogging and nutrient leaching."

Regular scouting and monitoring: Inspect your orchard frequently to identify pest populations and take appropriate action.\n2. Biological control: Encourage natural predators like ladybugs or use beneficial insects to control pests.\n3. Trap crops: Plant specific crops that attract pests away from the main orchard.\n4. Physical barriers: Use netting or screens to prevent pest access to the orchard.\n5. Cultural practices: Implement techniques such as pruning, proper sanitation, and crop rotation to disrupt pest life cycles."
